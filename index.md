### About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Georgetown University. My research lies at the intersection of development and labor economics, examining how couples adjust labor supply in response to pension eligibility under weak social safety nets, with evidence from rural pension enrollees in China.

Before Georgetown, I worked as a Research Assistant in the World Bankâ€™s Development Research Group. I hold an M.A. in Economics from Duke University.
