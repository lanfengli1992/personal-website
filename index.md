### About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in [**Economics**](https://econ.georgetown.edu/academics/phd/phd-students/current-job-market/) at [**Georgetown University**](https://www.georgetown.edu/). My research lies at the intersection of development and labor economics, examining how couples adjust labor supply in response to pension eligibility under weak social safety nets, with evidence from rural pension enrollees in China.

Before and during my Ph.D., I worked at the World Bank Group for 6 years across 4 divisions, from the [**Development Research Group**](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/unit-dec/research), Poverty, Energy Global Practices, to Operations Policy & Country Services. I hold an M.A. in Economics from [**Duke University**](https://duke.edu/) and a B.A. in Actuarial Science from the [**Central University of Finance and Economics**](https://en.cufe.edu.cn/).

You can find my [**CV**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r-teq50qa436A-68XjMcysviCZgvx3ID/view?usp=sharing) here.

### Research

**Job Market Paper**  

**Displace Him, Deploy Her? Couple's Asymmetric Labor Responses to Pension Eligibility** (with Siming Ye) — [[Paper]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ltuGV9Ay6_rqI64jG_uSiJS_CuCFWP83/view?usp=sharing)

**Abstract:** This paper challenges the consensus that when one spouse retires, the other is more likely to retire as well because of their complementarities in leisure. We show theoretically that when pension replacement rates are low and households depend heavily on home production, one spouse’s retirement can instead increase the other spouse’s labor supply, as they substitute toward market work to offset lost earnings rather than toward shared leisure. Using a regression discontinuity design in rural China, we find that when husbands become pension-eligible, their wives’ labor supply rises substantially. Eligibility pushes men out of higher-wage formal jobs into home production while their pension replaces only a small share of lost income. These results reconcile conflicting evidence across labor and development economics and highlight how pension design can unintentionally place a greater burden of old-age security on women.
